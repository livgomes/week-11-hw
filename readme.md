# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-11
### 1. Summary

Week eleven of MART-341 allowed us to get more into the technical and aesthetic details that go into designing a webpage.
Main topics covered this week were the adding of background images to webpages and parallax scrolling. This week was alot of fun as it allowed me to start creating not only a visually pleasing webpage but also a well polished looking webpage.

**Parallax scrolling**-is an optical phenomenon which allows two different objects to change depending on the position you are within the webpage. It creates the image of objects moving at different speeds =, closer and further away from the viewer.

**Hero Image**-This is using an image as the main focus of the aspect of the webpage an individual is looking at, it commonly has other content over the image, which works as a description to what the website will be dealing with.

### Homework

This weeks homework entailed creating a new webpage that displayed a parallax scrolling, hero imagery and background images. For my webpage I chose to create a webpage focusing on the theme of Missoula and Montana in general. I used multiple images of Montana as background and hero images to draw the viewers attention to the beauty of the landscape and used title words such as Missoula, Montana, wildlife and wilderness to give the viewers a initial understanding of what will be discussed throughout the webpage. For the parallax scrolling, I allowed the interchanging of photographs to appear along the screen as the viewer scrolls up and down the webpage.

### Issues

The most common issue I had this week was trying to get the hero photos to remain in the order that I wanted it to be, as well as getting the text to appear on top of the image in the position and size that I wanted.

### Future Discussion

Overall I really enjoyed this weeks assignment and it makes me really excited to get started on the final project and take the extra time to put in extra effort in building my own personalized webpage.
